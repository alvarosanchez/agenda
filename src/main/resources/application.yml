However, we now live in a world dominated by the cloud, mobile, IoT, and open source, where containers, Kubernetes, microservices, reactive, Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), and cloud-native application development can deliver higher levels of productivity and efficiency.'

In this easy-to-follow workshop, you’ll explore real-world examples to collect, transform, and aggregate data, work with multiple processors, and handle real-time events. You’ll even dive into streaming SQL with KSQL!. Practical to the very end, it will finish with testing and operational aspects, such as monitoring and debugging.'

He will also explore how event collaboration and event sourcing patterns increase safety and recoverability in production databases.'

        - 'There''s a strong feeling that people don''t upgrade their Java version because they are scared of what''s going on with newer Java releases, especially after that moment when the release cadence has changed. So many OpenJDK projects have an open target, which makes people feel like there''s nothing happening with them because delivery time takes years, and so on. It feels like you are one of those developers, team leaders, managers who stuck with older versions of Java for certain reasons. And only things you have heard about modern Java that are freighting you so much? Let me ask you a few questions:'
        - '- How good you know modern Java?'
        - '- How good you know modern Java features?'
        - '- Aren’t you afraid of it yet?'
        - 'If you are one of those then this talk is for you (and your manager). In this talk. I’d like to talk 6 signs that you have no idea of what’s going on with modern Java:'
        - '- Java modules, no thank you;'
        - '- Java is not good for the cloud;'
        - '- JavaFX is dead;'
        - ' - OpenJDK projects (Valhalla, Loom, Panama) are cool, but no visual progress so far;'
        - ' - Java is not evolving; - GraalVM will replace Java HotSpot VM'

But with the advent of Cloud computing we have to rethink how big our applications should be, as well as how quickly they must be ready to start serving requests. Enter Micronaut, a refreshing framework that can be used to build traditional web applications as well as tiny microservices and anything in between. In this workshop you''ll get started with the basics, domain design, database acces, view scaffolding, monitoring, and more.'
